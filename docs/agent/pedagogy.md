# IGCSE Slide Pedagogy Playbook

Use this as the voice and sequencing guide when writing slide content. Keep the existing templates/macros intact and focus purely on clearer, more purposeful words and examples.

## Core principles
- Lead with a student-facing question, then reveal the answer/explanation.
- Always cover **Define → Why it matters → How it works (steps/model) → Clarify (misconception check)** before moving on.
- Keep one idea per slide; large readable text beats dense bullets.
- Connect to real products (addresses, colours, errors) so facts feel useful.
- End each concept with a short check-for-understanding (true/false or “try it now”).

## Slide patterns to reuse
- **Key term slide:** question (“What is …?”) + concise definition.
- **Why slide:** 2–3 bullet reasons the concept exists/helps.
- **How slide/stack:** vertical stepper; each step is a single action or decision. Start the stack with a framing question.
- **Modelled example:** show the full working for one example with a quick “check” line.
- **Clarify slide:** surface a common confusion and resolve it with a short explanation.
- **Application prompt:** “Where do we see this in the real world?” with 2–3 examples.
- **Misconception check:** true/false with explanations or a quick practice “Try now” plus an answer fragment.

## Modelling conversions (Topic 1.1)
- Use place-value tables for denary ↔ binary; highlight which bits contribute to the sum.
- For denary → binary: show subtraction against place values (or repeated division if needed); end with an overflow/range reminder tied to bit length.
- For denary ↔ hex: stress the 1-hex = 4-bit mapping; for denary → hex, divide by 16 and map remainders; for hex → denary, expand with 16s place values.
- For binary addition: line up bits, mark carries, then call out when a carry leaves the register (overflow).
- For two’s complement: anchor the 3-step algorithm (write positive, invert, add 1) and the 8-bit range (-128 to +127).
- For logical shifts: link direction to effect (×2 per left shift, ÷2 per right shift, truncated); remind that shifted-out bits are lost.

## Tone and micro-moves
- Use imperative, student-facing verbs: “Write”, “Group”, “Map”, “Check”.
- Include “Why does this matter?” and “Where have you seen this?” prompts.
- Prefer short, concrete numbers (e.g., 156, 94, 3C, -25) with full workings.
- State ranges when introducing signed/unsigned representations.
- When calling out mistakes, phrase them as questions: “Does left shift divide or multiply?” then resolve.

Keep this playbook open while writing. It should make the decks feel purposeful without changing any template code.
